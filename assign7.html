        <h1>
      Basic HTML Animals
    </h1>
    This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.

    <h2>
      The Llama
    </h2>

    Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

    <h2>
      The Anaconda
    </h2>

    The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.

    <p>There are two things I care about — music and friends. Someday I might be able to get my friends interested in each other, and my music!</p>
